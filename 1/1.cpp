#include<iostream> // Tells the preprocessor to include iostream (input/output stream) in the header file of the program, making its functions available for use in the program

int main() // return type is "int" because it returns 0
{
  std::cout << "Hello World\n"; // Cout used to render text on the console comes from the standard namespace
  return 0; // Indicates to program that nothing "broke" in the function
